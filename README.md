# Data Translation Challenge: Mobile Phone Sales Trends on Amazon (2019)

**Author**: Nishanth Sudhaharan

## Introduction

This analysis focuses on the sales trends of three mobile phones — iPhone, Google Pixel, and Vareebadd — on Amazon in 2019. The goal is to identify the key patterns in the sales data, especially focusing on fluctuations and their potential causes. The sales data for these phones were analyzed across various urban cities, tracking quantities sold per day every month throughout the year.

## Sales Trend Overview

The analysis reveals that although the sales volumes for each phone varied day by day, they followed similar seasonal trends. All three phones experienced a decline in sales starting from April and continuing until August. Following August, the sales began to gradually increase again.

This pattern prompted further investigation into the possible causes for these fluctuations, especially the impact of product releases and seasonal factors.

## Key Insights

### iPhone Sales Trends:
- The sales of iPhones saw a clear decline towards the middle of the year, particularly leading up to the expected release of the **iPhone 11** in August.
- It is likely that customers delayed their purchase of the iPhone, anticipating the upcoming release of the newer model. As expected, after the launch of the iPhone 11, there was a significant increase in sales towards the latter part of 2019.

### Google Pixel Sales Trends:
- Google released the **Pixel 3a** in April 2019, followed by the **Pixel 4** in September 2019.
- The initial release of the Pixel 3a saw a drop in sales, with sales figures remaining steady for a while before declining further in the months of April, May, June, and July.
- However, after the launch of the Pixel 4 in September, the sales for Google Pixel phones experienced a significant rebound, doubling from approximately 10 phones sold per day to 20 phones sold per day by the end of December.

### Vareebadd Sales Trends:
- While **Vareebadd** is not as widely recognized as the iPhone or Google Pixel, it still followed the same seasonal sales pattern. The sales dropped in the summer months and began increasing again in August, mirroring the trends observed with the iPhone and Google Pixel.

## Analysis of Sales Trends

The data clearly suggests that product launches have a significant impact on the sales of mobile phones. Sales tend to decline before the release of a newer version of the phone, as potential buyers wait for the latest model. This effect is evident for all three phones analyzed in this study.

## Recommendations to Manage Sales During Low Seasons

Based on the observed sales patterns, here are some strategies that could be employed to reduce the drop in sales during the pre-launch periods:
1. **Discounted Pricing**: Reducing the price of the current model before a new version is launched could incentivize customers to make a purchase.
2. **Promotions and Offers**: Providing additional offers or gifts with the current model can help boost sales during the slow months leading up to the release of new models.
3. **Marketing Campaigns**: Running targeted marketing campaigns to highlight the current phone's features and benefits can help maintain interest during slower periods.

## Conclusion

The sales trends of the iPhone, Google Pixel, and Vareebadd phones on Amazon in 2019 were influenced by seasonal factors and product releases. Understanding these trends can help mobile sales managers better anticipate fluctuations in demand and implement strategies to mitigate sales declines during the pre-launch months. By using pricing strategies, promotional offers, and effective marketing, the negative impacts of these dips can be minimized.
